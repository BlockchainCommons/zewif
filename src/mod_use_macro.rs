/// A macro that simplifies module declarations and re-exports in a single statement.
///
/// The `mod_use!` macro provides a convenient way to declare modules and re-export
/// their contents in a single operation. This greatly reduces boilerplate code when
/// organizing a codebase with many related modules, especially when those modules
/// are intended to be made available through their parent module.
///
/// # Zcash Concept Relation
/// In the ZeWIF codebase, many Zcash protocol elements are organized into logical
/// groupings, such as transaction components, key types, and protocol-specific structures
/// (Sapling, Sprout, Orchard). The `mod_use!` macro helps maintain clean organization
/// while ensuring proper exports.
///
/// # Examples
/// ```ignore
/// # // This example is in a documentation comment, so we don't need to import macro
/// # mod example {
/// use crate::mod_use;
///
/// // Using the macro to define and export three modules
/// mod_use!(
///     transaction_components,
///     key_types,
///     address_formats
/// );
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// This expands to:
/// ```ignore
/// # mod example {
/// mod transaction_components; 
/// pub use transaction_components::*;
/// 
/// mod key_types; 
/// pub use key_types::*;
/// 
/// mod address_formats; 
/// pub use address_formats::*;
/// # }
/// ```
