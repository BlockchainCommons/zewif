/// A transparent address on the Zcash network.
///
/// An [`Address`] represents a transparent Zcash address, having an encoding that begins with 't'
/// and that functions similarly to Bitcoin addresses. These addresses offer no privacy features -
/// all spends from and receives to transparent addresses are visible on the blockchain.
///
/// # Zcash Concept Relation
/// Zcash supports transparent addresses for backward compatibility with Bitcoin
/// infrastructure. Two main types exist:
///
/// - **P2PKH** (Pay to Public Key Hash): Standard addresses that begin with 't1'
/// - **P2SH** (Pay to Script Hash): Script-based addresses that begin with 't3'
///
/// Transparent addresses make transaction data publicly visible, including:
/// - Sender address
/// - Receiver address
/// - Transaction amount
/// - Transaction time
///
/// # Data Preservation
/// During wallet migration, the following components are preserved:
///
/// - **Address string**: The canonical string representation (e.g., "t1...")
/// - **Spending authority**: Private key information needed to spend funds
/// - **Derivation information**: HD wallet path data for derived addresses
///
/// # Examples
/// ```
/// # use zewif::{DerivationInfo, NonHardenedChildIndex, transparent::{self, TransparentSpendAuthority}};
/// // Create a new transparent address
/// let mut address = transparent::Address::new("t1exampleaddress");
///
/// // Set the spending authority (usually a derived key for HD wallets)
/// let spend_authority = TransparentSpendAuthority::Derived;
/// address.set_spend_authority(spend_authority);
///
/// // For HD wallets, set the derivation information
/// let change = NonHardenedChildIndex::from(0u32); // external chain
/// let address_index = NonHardenedChildIndex::from(3u32); // 4th address in chain
/// let derivation_info = DerivationInfo::new(change, address_index);
/// address.set_derivation_info(derivation_info);
///
/// // Access the address string
/// assert_eq!(address.address(), "t1exampleaddress");
