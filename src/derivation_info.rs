/// Hierarchical deterministic (HD) derivation information for wallet addresses.
///
/// `DerivationInfo` captures the BIP-44/ZIP-32 derivation path components for
/// addresses in a hierarchical deterministic wallet. It specifically tracks the
/// last two non-hardened components of an HD path:
/// - Whether it's a change address (typically 0 = external, 1 = change)
/// - The address index within that chain
///
/// # Zcash Concept Relation
/// Zcash follows BIP-44 and ZIP-32 for hierarchical deterministic key derivation,
/// with paths typically structured as:
/// ```text
/// m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index
/// ```
///
/// Where:
/// - `purpose'` is typically 44' for transparent or 32' for shielded
/// - `coin_type'` is 133' for Zcash
/// - `account'` is the account number (hardened)
/// - `change` is 0 for external addresses or 1 for internal (change) addresses
/// - `address_index` is the sequential index of the address
///
/// The apostrophes (') indicate hardened derivation, which prevents parent key
/// compromise from affecting child keys.
///
/// # Data Preservation
/// During wallet migration, this information is preserved to maintain the
/// hierarchical relationship between keys and the ability to derive the same
/// addresses in the new wallet.
///
/// # Examples
/// ```
/// # use zewif::{DerivationInfo, NonHardenedChildIndex};
/// // Create derivation info for an external address (change = 0)
/// // with index 5
/// let change = NonHardenedChildIndex::from(0u32); // external
/// let address_index = NonHardenedChildIndex::from(5u32);
///
/// // We need a constructor to create DerivationInfo
/// let derivation_info = DerivationInfo::new(change, address_index);
///
/// // The values can be retrieved for further derivation or reference
/// assert_eq!(u32::from(derivation_info.change()), 0);
/// assert_eq!(u32::from(derivation_info.address_index()), 5);
/// ```
