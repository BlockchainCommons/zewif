/// Represents a sent output in an Orchard shielded transaction within a Zcash wallet.
///
/// `OrchardSentOutput` stores the plaintext details of an Orchard note that was sent by the
/// wallet, which are not recoverable from the blockchain after transmission. This information
/// enables selective disclosure, allowing a sender to prove they made a payment to a specific
/// shielded address without revealing additional transaction details.
///
/// # Zcash Concept Relation
/// In Zcash's Orchard protocol (introduced in Network Upgrade 5):
///
/// - **Orchard** represents the next-generation shielded protocol after Sapling
/// - **Improved cryptography** using the Pallas elliptic curve (instead of Jubjub in Sapling)
/// - **Enhanced privacy** with design improvements over earlier protocols
/// - **Halo 2 proving system** replaces the previous trusted setup zk-SNARKs
///
/// Each sent output contains components of the Orchard note:
/// - Diversifier: Part of the recipient's shielded address derivation
/// - Public key: The recipient's public key for the transaction
/// - Value: The amount of ZEC transferred
/// - Rho/Psi: Protocol-specific randomness values
/// - Rcm: Random commitment material
///
/// # Data Preservation
/// During wallet migration, Orchard sent output information must be preserved to maintain
/// the ability to generate payment proofs for regulatory compliance, auditing,
/// or other selective disclosure purposes. The sending wallet is the only entity
/// that has this information in plaintext form.
///
/// # Examples
/// ```
/// # use zewif::{orchard::OrchardSentOutput, Blob, Amount};
/// # use anyhow::Result;
/// # fn example() -> Result<()> {
/// // Create a new Orchard sent output with all required components
/// let value = Amount::from_u64(10_000_000)?; // 0.1 ZEC
///
/// let sent_output = OrchardSentOutput::from_parts(
///     0,
///     "".to_string(),
///     value,
///     None
/// );
///
/// // Check the value was set correctly
/// let value_zatoshi: i64 = sent_output.value().into();
/// assert_eq!(value_zatoshi, 10_000_000);
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
